    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Beans and rice is a personal favorite of mine. I used to live on $3 CAD a day
        and would rely on beans and rice to feed me. Cheap, simple, and using ingredients effectively,
        I still make beans and rice regularly as comfort food in the colder months.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can Beans (black or red kidney)</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock, plus additional water if needed</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 rib of celery</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 glug olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch white all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Cayenne</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (optional)</li>
        <li>Cilantro (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I add additional spices when making this for myself,
        but those spices will remain secret.
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a large pan on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Dice the onion and celery and add to the pan. 
            Stir regularly  and cook until the onions are 
            translucent.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic and add to the pan. 
            Cook for around 1 min.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour into the pan and stir. 
            This will create a roux. 
            Add more olive oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper, and spices (
            except lemon juice and cilantro) to taste. I will not
            tell you how much to add. I am a master of spices 
            and I refuse to share my secrets. </li>
        <li>Add the beans (liquid included), rice, and stock to 
            the pan and cover. 
            Let cook for approx. 15 min, stirring regularly. 
            Add water if the pan begins to run dry and 
            the rice is not cooked.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, uncover and take pan off
            heat. Plate beans & rice into bowls. Add a spritz of 
            lemon juice and some chopped cilantro on top and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
