    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Some people hate brussel sprouts. They've hated them
        since they were kids and they've never bothered to 
        change their mind. Those people are wrong. Brussel 
        sprouts, when cooked right, absolutely whip. I have
        a bad habit of calling them "Brussels Sprouts" because
        I have a false association between the name and the
        city of Brussels, which does have that extra S. You 
        may see me make that typo in this very recipe!
    </p>
    <p>This recipe works for any amount of brussel sprouts, 
        provided you have a pan large enough to fit them on.
        Scale up the salt, pepper, and olive oil as needed. 
        I assume you are an adult that can figure out how much
        salt, pepper, and olive oil you need to roast some 
        vegetables in an oven, but do make sure you add enough
        olive oil to completely coat the brussel sprouts.
        Otherwise some sprouts will come out flavorless and 
        nasty.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brussel sprouts, stems cut off and chopped in half.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F.
            Line a baking tray with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, add brussel sprouts, salt, pepper,
            and olive oil. Stir to combine until all the 
            sprouts are coated with olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Add sprouts to the tray. For best results, place
            each sprout with its flat, cross-sectioned face
            down on the tray.
        </li>
        <li>Cook in the oven for 50 minutes or until the 
            sprouts are golden brown. Serve.
